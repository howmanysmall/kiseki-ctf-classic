# Kiseki CTF: Classic Edition [v1.2]
A rescripted version of Clockwork and Conix's game "Kiseki". This is the source code repository in case you wanna see how god awful my coding is.

## Update Lob [v1.2]
* Shinobi has been reworked! The class now features a better Assassination tool and a brand new Katana! When right clicking on the Katana, you will be able to dash towards your target (or just to escape).
* Jetboots system implimented! Some maps were impossible to play up until this point due to how high the flag was.
* New class system has been implimented! Instead of it being based off of t-shirts, you can now press V on your keyboard to change classes. *Bye bye legacy class system!*
* UI system has been updated. Now there's a little waiting screen and a new loading screen that actually loads assets!
* Map system updated! Some maps now feature custom sky boxes and atmosphere.
* Ice Shards, Soul Bolt, Bash, Pacifism, T-Storm, and Monsoon have been updated to become a lot better.
* Personality system has been temporary removed til next update (which will probably be v1.2b).
* Socom and Barrett stats have been updated.
* Faerie Knight can now jump way higher than before! Which means that Jetboots do not work on Faerie Knight.

## Update Log [v1.1]
* Meat Hook is now functional!
* Three new maps: Snowblivion, Kyrbej, and Glasshouse!
* Round time lowered to 3 minutes instead of 5.
* Updated Stun Ward, Meteor, Thunderstorm, and Sac Ritual.
* Removed Ice Shards til next major update.
* Fixed error issues with finding the first blood.
* Gun System is now souly based on Raycasting instead of projectiles. Goobye legacy!
* Fixed issues with M79's bullet curving upwards instead of being a proper arc.
* LAW fires faster now instead of just clicking furiously just to fire it.
* Modified the Stun Ward to make it based off of "Raycasting" (or at least something similar to raycasting)
* Modified & cleaned up Meteor, Sac Ritual, Thunderstorm, and Stun Ward. I will probably re-do Meteor and Thunderstorm in the future.

## Future Changes (for next update)
* Abscond, Disarm, Sentry Gun, Bite, Feeding Frenzy, Duress, and Defile will be either reworked into something better, modified, or fixed.
* Add a Ragdoll system *(so Corpse Explosion will be easier to use)*.
* Add a new Personality system.
* Update all the maps to be a bit more "modern".
* Two new classes *(maybe? probably not)*.
* Modifying more legacy coding.
