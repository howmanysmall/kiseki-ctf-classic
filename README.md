# Kiseki CTF: Classic Edition [v1.1b]
A rescripted version of Clockwork and Conix's game "Kiseki". This is the source code repository in case you wanna see how god awful my coding is.

## Update Log [v1.1]
* Meat Hook is now functional!
* Three new maps: Snowblivion, Kyrbej, and Glasshouse!
* Round time lowered to 3 minutes instead of 5.
* Updated Stun Ward, Meteor, Thunderstorm, and Sac Ritual.
* Removed Ice Shards til next major update.
* Fixed error issues with finding the first blood.
* Gun System is now souly based on Raycasting instead of projectiles. Goobye legacy!
* Fixed issues with M79's bullet curving upwards instead of being a proper arc.
* LAW fires faster now instead of just clicking furiously just to fire it.
* Modified the Stun Ward to make it based off of "Raycasting" (or at least something similar to raycasting)
* Modified & cleaned up Meteor, Sac Ritual, Thunderstorm, and Stun Ward. I will probably re-do Meteor and Thunderstorm in the future.

## Future Changes (for next update)
* Ice Shards, Soul Bolt, Bash, Abscond, Disarm, Sentry Gun, Bite, Feeding Frenzy, Pacifism, Duress, and Defile will be either reworked into something better, modified, or fixed.
* Shinobi will be recieving a major overhaul as well.
* A ragdoll system will be added too.
* Example place will be created for those who are interested in using Kiseki CTF: Classic Edition for their own game.
* Modifying more legacy coding.
